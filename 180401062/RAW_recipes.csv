when it came out of the oven, 10 people were standing in my kitchen, and they sort of collectively gasped.  one of our (non-family) guests asked, ""where did you get that turkey?  and what did you do to it?  it looks like something out of a magazine!""  :)

to my absolute delight, it tasted as good as it looked!  everybody said it was the juiciest, most flavorful turkey they'd ever eaten.  so, yeah, ""flipping the bird"" works even when it's the big bird!

i baked 2 pieces at a time on baking paper on an oven tray. each batch took just long enough to cook, that i had two more ready to swap when the first ones were done.

the cream filling (and coating) is made from sour cream and sugar. the sour cream is simply whipped with the sugar until the sugar dissolves. the original recipe said to add sugar ""by intuition""; i think you're supposed to keep adding more until it thickens, but the time i tried that it was too sickly sweet!

i have also made the filling/coating using fresh cream - 750ml, soured with 1/2 cup lemon juice and beaten until just starting to thicken (you still use the sugar & honey). this was for a vegetarian who pointed out that the cultured sour cream i used had gelatin in it. a slightly different taste, but a very nice variation.

i personally don't like walnuts all that much, so i leave them out whenever i cook this.","['eggs', 'sugar', 'baking soda', 'liquid honey', 'margarine', 'flour', 'sour cream', 'honey', 'plain sweet biscuit crumbs', 'ground walnuts']",10

this recipe is butter-basted white bread; i got this from a book in the library, i cannot remember the title or author.
i make this bread for my mother and friend who cannot have gluten in their diet.  they rave that this is better than the small store loafs and love that it cuts without crumbling and ideal for sandwiches, toast etc, they both prefer the 1 white/1 brown rice flour mix with linseed and sunflower seeds for taste and texture.  
the minimum setting i have on my bread machine is 4 hours, the bread cooks fine on this for me.

""then ali baba climbed down and went to the door concealed among the bushes, and said, ""open, sesame!"" and it flew open. 
ali baba, who expected a dull, dismal place, was greatly surprised to find it large and well lighted, hollowed by the hand of man in the form of a vault, which received the light from an opening in the ceiling. he saw rich bales of merchandise -- silk, stuff-brocades, all piled together, and gold and silver in heaps, and money in leather purses. he went in and the door shut behind him. he did not look at the silver, but brought out as many bags of gold as he thought he could carry.""  :)

she used to bring over some of the most amazing goodies! i have searched and baked and bought, but never found a shortbread recipe that was anything like as good as this. fortunately my mum found a 'new' copy of her much-spattered cookbook and she gave me her old one which had this recipe manually type-written and stuck into it. nobody, but nobody!, bakes better shortbread than i occasionally treat myself to (i do share some of it!) when i bake using this recipe!!! do try this one - it's just the ultimate! :) despite the scots preference for slightly warmed shortbread i strongly urge you to wait until it's fully cold before devouring - not refrigerated cold, but ideally no warmer (or cooler really) than a cool room temperature. the instructions call for some care in the preparation but as i'm passing on the tips as they were given to me when i was between 8 to 10 years old, i'll pass them on to you rather than leave them out. - she felt they were important for best results, and the resulting shortbread proves she knew what she was talking about! the recipe is very simple and robust enough that a child can make it well, but the best results will come from taking extra special care.  this recipe doesn't double well either, sadly.  do especially keep that mixture cool and do it by hand not machine – it’s only a few minutes of fussing about after all!

marno mcdermott was a successful minneapolis restaurateur, opening a chain of mexican restaurants in the seventies called zapata's against the advice of skeptics who said he would never able to sell mexican food to the large population of scandinavians in the area. marno proved them wrong then, and once again in 1976, when he partnered with max mcgee, a former green bay packer football player, to open the first chi-chi's in richfield, minnesota. the restaurant was built inside a deserted kroger grocery store and became instantly famous for the intensely flavored and larger-than-usual portions of food. to keep volume high, chi-chi's designed a custom computer-driven system that clocks every aspect of service from the time each server enters an order to when the order is placed in front of customers. special attention was given to the design of the menus as well, with each dish taking no more than nine minutes to prepare, even during the rush hours. 

since you're starting from scratch, this appetizer will probably take longer than nine minutes to make. you can choose to make the nachos from stor-bought tortilla chips or make them yourself from the *tidbits (see below).  personally, i think the fresh, home-fried type tastes best. if you're up to the task, amigos, i say give it a go.","['ground beef', 'chili powder', 'salt', 'dried onion flakes', 'paprika', 'water', 'corn tortilla chips', 'refried beans', 'shredded cheddar cheese', 'monterey jack cheese', 'diced onion', 'red jalapeno chile', 'sour cream', 'guacamole', 'salsa']",15
